## Quiz

There's a simple quiz at the bottom if you want to use this form to award prizes. If the user gets 100% they can show the booth worker and get a prize. Add `?quiz=true` to the URL to show the quiz.

### New Choice Interface

When the quiz URL parameter is present (`?quiz=true`), users are now presented with a choice:

1. **ðŸ§¦ Take Quiz & Win Socks!** - Shows the Cloudinary transformation quiz
2. **ðŸ¦„ Get Unicorn Magic!** - Shows a Marketo embed form

### New Tab Interface

1. **ðŸ§¦ Quiz & Socks Tab** - Shows the Cloudinary transformation quiz
2. **ðŸ¦„ Unicorn Magic Tab** - Shows a Marketo embed form

Users can easily switch between tabs to explore both options, and the quiz tab is selected by default.

  <!-- Replace this div with your Marketo embed code -->
  <script src="//app-sj20.marketo.com/js/forms2/js/forms2.min.js"></script>
  <form id="mktoForm_1234"></form>
  <script>MktoForms2.loadForm("//app-sj20.marketo.com", "123-ABC-456", 1234);</script>
</div>
